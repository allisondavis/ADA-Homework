## Module 07
###*Additional Data Structures in R*

* Matrix: a 2D structure of vectors
    + vectors splits into rows *or* columns of same length.
    + only one data class! 
    + created using **matrix()** function.
    + **byrow = FALSE/TRUE** will fill the matrix column-wise/row-wise; FALSE is defualt.
    + can create a matrix from existing vectors using **bind()**
        - cbind() for column-wise *or* rbind() for row-wise
            [*rownames/colnames will not exist for cbind/rbind respectively*]
                - all need to be the same class!


* Array: multi-dimensional data structure
    + still must all have same data class
    + can specify levels: dim=c(x,y,z)
        -will create z seperate matrices of dimensions x and y
        - ex: a<- array(data=1:90, dim=c(5,6,3)) will return the numbers 1-90 in 5 rows, 6 columns, and 3 seperate visual levels (1-30, 31-60, 61-90)
        
* ***Cool tools:*** 
    + Subsetting ([])
        - can extract with singular position values, vectors, or functions
    + overwriting: following subsetting, can assign new value or set of values

* Lists: mix of data structures
    + lists created using **list()**
        - can subset in lists using [[]]
                - can be used in conjuction with regular subsetting ([]) to access an element in an element
        - single bracket alone ([]) will remove whole list elements
                - ex: l[2:3] will pull out list element 2 and list element 3

***
***CHALLENGE 4***

***


* Data frames: mix of data structure; rows = cases/observations and columns as variables 
    + variables same units so same data class (vectors)
    + all the same length
    + **data.frame()** used to create one from scratch
    + can select named columns using $ or [[]]
    + can use rbind or cbind to add rows/columns
        - can use $ or [[]] to add new variable
                - ex: df$school <- c("UT", "A&M", "Rice")
                - ex: df[["school"]] <- ("UT", "A&M")
    + can use == to filter rows
        - can use **&** or **|** for more specific filtering
    + **[c("column header")]** will filter columns
        - a *-* before "c" will return all columns *but* those specified
        
* Factors, Variable Conversion/Coercion, and Special Data Values
    + factor: numeric codes that correspond to character value "levels"
    + can convert between factor, character, and numeric using **as.character()**, **as.factor()**, **as.numeric()**
        - character --> numeric turns it into NA (not available; used for missing data)
                - can exclude NAs from calcs using **na.rm=TRUE**
    + Inf/-Inf: numerical calc too extreme
    + NaN: can't display calc results

***CHALLENGE 5***

* Other Data Frame Like Structures
    + data tables: enhancements to data frame
        - need {data.table} package
        - easier to filter, easier syntax, doesn't change characters into factors automatically
    + "tibbles": enhancement to data frame
        - need {tibble} package
        - doesn't change characters into factors, doesn't do partial subsetting matches, shows characters of each header, can't recycle vectors other than 1 value



## Module 08
### Getting Data into R

* Plain text files: best and oldest method for storing data
    + loading: 
        - **read.table()** can load data set
                - *file=* file path
                - *header=*  first row w/ field names
                - *sep=* delimiter character
                - *skip=* starts reading after n rows
                - can also be file specific, like csv in place of table
    + reading:
        - **file.choose()** 
                - csv:
                - tsv/txt:
        - {readr} package:

* Excel Files:
    + loading:
        - {readxl} package: easiest method; yields a tibble
        - {XLConnect} package: can also write/create back out to excel

* Files stored on remote server (dropbox,github, google drive, etc)
    + loading: 
        - {curl} package: HTTP request to read from URL
                - can read in csv or txt format
    + importing: {readr} package
        - works with http/https/ftp/fttps
    + importing from dropbox: {rdrop2} package
        - can also download files directly
    +importing from UTbox: link or {repmis} package
        -
    +importing from google spreadsheet: {googlesheets} package
        - can also download files directly
* ***Cool tool:*** {googledrive} package allows you to search, download, upload and manipulate files.
